### Description

I originally wrote this to scan my directories and sub-directories, then list the most recently saved VB Projects. I know that when I open VB, I can choose 'Recent' and pick from that list. However, when I download and try many programs from PSC, plus a few more of my own, that list quickly becomes quite cumbersome and it really doesn't tell me which ones I have edited. It also can list programs that have already been moved or deleted. So I wrote this.

Version 2.0.0 (May 30, 2007)

I changed the colors for a more standard Windows look.

I added this Help file and a whole NEW Menu system.

I replaced the TextBox with a RichTextBox.

The output list is saved to a text file which you may delete from the Popup Menu.

Note: The Fonts and colors may vary from the screenshot.
 
### More Info

A sorted list matching your criteria.
