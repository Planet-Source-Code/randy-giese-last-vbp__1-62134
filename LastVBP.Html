<Font Size="4" Color="SpringGreen"><B>

 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I originally wrote <Font Color="Red"> LastVBP <Font Color="SpringGreen"> to scan my directories and sub-directories, then to list the most recently saved VB Projects. &nbsp I know that when I open VB, I can choose <Font Color="Yellow"> Recent <Font Color="SpringGreen"> and pick from that list. &nbsp However, when I download and try many programs from PSC, plus a few more of my own, that list quickly becomes quite cumbersome and it really doesn't tell me which ones I have edited. &nbsp It also can list programs that have already been moved or deleted. &nbsp That's why I wrote <Font Color="Red"> LastVBP<Font Color="SpringGreen">. &nbsp But please read on to see what else I discovered.<BR><BR>

 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I had planned to just list the 10 most recent projects, but hadn't gotten around to that yet when I discovered something interesting. &nbsp Besides listing the most recently used projects, it also lists the oldest projects (actually, it lists ALL projects in ALL sub-directories that you choose). &nbsp So by checking the bottom of the list, you may find some oldies that either need your attention or may not be of any use anymore. &nbsp You may also find some oldies that were stuck away in a sub-directory and forgotten about.<BR><BR>

 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Then I decided that this program might be useful for finding other File Types too. &nbsp Such as <Font Color="Yellow"> *.Frm<Font Color="SpringGreen">, <Font Color="Yellow"> *.Bas<Font Color="SpringGreen">, etc, so I added  the 'txtFileType' Text Box. &nbsp You may enter any File Type you like and scan for it. &nbsp The program will list All files matching your criteria, sorted in Date order (most recent to oldest).<BR><BR>

<Font Color="Cyan"> Inputs<Font Color="SpringGreen">:
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp You may change the File Type or use the default <Font Color="Yellow"> *.Vbp<Font Color="SpringGreen">.<BR><BR>

<Font Color="Cyan"> Returns<Font Color="SpringGreen">:
 &nbsp &nbsp A sorted list matching your criteria.<BR><BR>

<Font Color="Cyan"> Version 2.0.0 (May 30, 2007)<Font Color="SpringGreen">:
I've made quite a few improvements since the First version.<BR>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I changed the funky colors for a more standard Windows look.<BR>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I added this Help file and a "Right-Click" Popup Menu.<BR>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp I replaced the TextBox with a RichTextBox. &nbsp I didn't realize it but with the original TextBox, if there was too much data for it to hold, it just quit without any warning or error messages. &nbsp This resulted in what looked like a normal EOJ but the output list was incomplete.<BR>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The output list is saved to a text file named (App.Path & "\Ra.ndy"). &nbsp It will be saved in the same folder the program is in. &nbsp The file will be overwritten each time you use <Font Color="Red"> LastVBP <Font Color="SpringGreen"> or you may delete it from the Popup Menu.<BR>
